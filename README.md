# K8TRE AWS base infrastructure

[![Lint](https://github.com/manics/k8tre-infrastructure-aws/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/manics/k8tre-infrastructure-aws/actions/workflows/lint.yml)

Deploy AWS infrastructure using Terraform to support [K8TRE](https://github.com/k8tre/k8tre).

## First time

You must first create a S3 bucket to store the [Terraform state file](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state).
Activate your AWS credentials in your shell environment, edit the `resource.aws_s3_bucket.bucket` `bucket` name in [`bootstrap/backend.tf`](bootstrap/backend.tf), then:

```sh
cd bootstrap
terraform init
terraform apply
cd ..
```

## Deploy Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

By default this will deploy two EKS clusters:

- `k8tre-dev-argocd` is where ArgoCD will run
- `k8tre-dev` is where K8TRE will be deployed

IAM roles and pod identities are setup to allow ArgoCD running in the `k8tre-dev-argocd` cluster to have admin access to the `k8tre-dev` cluster.

### Configuration

Edit [`provider.tf`](provider.tf).
You must modify `terraform.backend.s3` `bucket` to match the one in `bootstrap/backend.tf`.

You can install K8TRE AWS with no changes, but you will most likely want to set some variables.
Either modify [`variables.tf`](variables.tf), or copy [`overrides.tfvars-example`](overrides.tfvars-example) to `overrides.tfvars` and edit.

Particularly important variables include

- `dns_domain`: The domain for K8TRE
- `request_certificate`: K8TRE requires a HTTPS certificate to be stored in AWS ACM, set this to `acm` to request a proper certificate instead of using a self-signed one.
- `number_availability_zones`: By default the deployed clusters run in a single availability zone to make it easier to deal with `ReadWriteOnce` persistent volumes which are backed by EBS volumes, which are tied to a single AZ.
  Increasing this provides more resilience to AWS outages, at the expense of needing more nodes in all AZs since once an EBS volume for a pod has been provisioned that pod can only ever be run in that AZ.

### Run Terraform

Activate your AWS credentials in your shell environment.
Terraform must be applied in several stages.
This is because Terraform needs to resolve some resources before running, but some of these resources don't initially exist.

Initialise Terraform providers and modules:

```sh
terraform init
```

Deploy the EKS cluster control plane, a Route 53 Private Zone, EFS, and HTTPS certificate:

```sh
terraform apply -var-file=overrides.tfvars -var deployment_stage=0
```

If you set `request_certificate = "acm"` then [create the DNS validation records](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/dns-validation.html) shown in the output.

Deploy EKS compute nodes, and Cilium:

```sh
terraform apply -var-file=overrides.tfvars -var deployment_stage=1
```

Deploy ArgoCD and some other prerequisites:

```sh
terraform apply -var-file=overrides.tfvars -var deployment_stage=2
```

Deploy K8TRE

```sh
terraform apply -var-file=overrides.tfvars -var deployment_stage=3
```

If any commands file or timeout try rerunning them.

### K8TRE secrets

K8TRE requires several secrets in AWS SSM, such as credentials for applications.
You can use the `create-ci-secrets.py` script in the K8TRE repository to create them:

```sh
uv run create-ci-secrets.py --backend aws-ssm --region eu-west-2
```

### Kubernetes access

`terraform apply` should display the command to create a [kubeconfig file](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/) for the `k8tre-dev` and `k8tre-dev-argocd` clusters.

### ArgoCD access

For convenience you can run the [`./argocd-portforward.sh`](`argocd-portforward.sh`) to start a port-forward to the ArgoCD web interface.
Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser and login with username `admin` nd the password displayed by the script.

If any Applications are not healthy check them, and if necessary try forcing a sync, or forcing broken resources to be recreated.

## K8TRE deploymenet overview

![K8TRE deployment overview](docs/k8tre-aws-infra-account.drawio.svg)

This deployment requires you to have administative access to an AWS Account, but assumes your AWS organisation and your DNS infrastructure are managed by a separate entity from the one deploying K8TRE.

It does not attempt to configure anything outside this single AWS account, nor does it configure any public DNS.
We recommend you use an [ACM managed public certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-public-certificates.html).
This deployment can request a certificate for you, but you must setup the DNS validation records yourself.
Once this is done you can proceed with deploying K8TRE, and the internal Application Load Balancer created by K8TRE should automatically use the certfiicate.

EKS is deployed in a private subnet, with NAT gateway to a public subnet.
By default the cluster has a single EKS node group in a single subnet (single availability zone) to reduce costs, and to avoid multi-AZ storage.

A prefix list `${var.cluster_name}-service-access-cidrs` is provided for convenience
This is not used in any Terraform resource, but can be referenced in other resources such as Application load balancers deployed in EKS.

## AWS Organisation

This repository only manages the K8TRE infrastructure for a single AWS account.
We strongly recommend you setup a multi-account AWS Organisation, for example using [AWS Control Tower](https://aws.amazon.com/controltower/) or [Landing Zone Accelerator on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/landing-zone-accelerator-on-aws/).

This organisation should include monitoring and security tools, either using AWS services or a third party alternative.

For example:

## Developer notes

To debug Argocd inter-cluster auth:

```sh
kubectl -nargocd exec -it deploy/argocd-server -- bash

argocd-k8s-auth aws --cluster-name k8tre-dev --role-arn arn:aws:iam::${ACCOUNT_ID}:role/k8tre-dev-eks-access
```

### Linting

When making changes to this repository run:

```sh
terraform validate
prek run -a
```

prek (or pre-commit) will run some autoformatters, and TFlint.
