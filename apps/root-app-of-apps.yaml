# This is an ArgoCD Application manifest that serves as a parent application
# for managing multiple child applications. It is designed to be used with
# the ApplicationSet controller, which allows for dynamic generation of
# applications based on a set of parameters or templates.
# This manifest is part of a GitOps workflow, where the desired state of
# applications is defined in Git repositories.
